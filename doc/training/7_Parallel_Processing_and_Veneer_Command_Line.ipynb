    "# Session 7 - Parallel Processing and the Veneer command line\n",
    "\n",
    "This session looks at options for parallel processing with Veneer - that is, by running multiple copies of Source, each with a Veneer server running, and giving instructions to each running copy in parallel.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can establish multiple copies of Source/Veneer by running multiple copies of the Source application, loading a project and starting the Web Server Monitoring window on each one. Alternatively, you can use the Vener Command Line, which presents the same interface to Python and other systems, without the overheads of the user interface.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session shows how you can run the Veneer command line and use it from Python as you would the main Source application. \n",

    "- Launching multiple copies of Veneer command line using veneer-py\n",
    "- Running simulations in parallel\n",

    "**Note:** This session uses `ExampleProject/RiverModel1.rsproj`. You are welcome to work with your own model instead, however you will need to change the notebook text at certain points to reflect the names of nodes, links and functions in your model file.\n"

    "## The Veneer Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The Veneer command line is a standalone executable program that runs the Source engine and exposes the Veneer network interface, without the main Source user interface. This means that all the veneer-py functionality able to be used whether you are running the Source application or the Veneer command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the command line\n",
    "\n",
    "The Veneer Command Line is distributed with Veneer, although the setup process is a little different to the regular Veneer. The Veneer Command Line is a standalone, executable program (specifically `FlowMatters.Source.VeneerCmd.exe`) and can be found in the directory where you installed (probably unzipped) Veneer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, where the Veneer plugin DLL can be installed and used from any directory, the Veneer Command Line needs access to all of the main libraries (DLLs) supplied with Source - and so the Veneer Command Line and the Source DLLs must reside in the same directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two options. You can either\n",
    "\n",
    "1. copy the program and the other files supplied with Veneer, into your main Source installation directory, or\n",
    "2. copy ALL of the files from the main Source directory into a common directory with Veneer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done so, you should be able to run the Veneer command line. You can launch the Veneer command line directory from a Windows command prompt. Alternatively, you can start one or more copies directly from Python using `veneer.manage.start` (described below).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because it is a common requirement for everyone to co-locate the Veneer Command Line with the files from the Source software, veneer-py includes a `create_command_line` function that performs the copy for you:"

    "The above example isn't as efficient as it could be, but it may be good enough for many circumstances.\n",

    "The simulations run in parallel, but everything else (configuring recorders, retrieving and post-processing results) is done sequentially. (And no simulations are taking place while that's happening). \n",
